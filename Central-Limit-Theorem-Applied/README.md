# Central-Limit-Theorem-Applied

Let A be a random variable which can be represented as the sum of a group of random variables.
A = K1 + K2 + ... + Kn; where K1,K2,...Kn are independent and identically distributed.

K1,K2,...Kn can be chosen as a sequence of uniform/exponential/Bernoulli/Poisson random variables.

This code plots the normalized PDF/CDF histogram of A vectors. A vectors contains 10000(arbitrary) sample for each n value. This code also plots Gaussian PDF/CDF to observe central limit theorem.
Gaussian parameters must be calculated by hand.
